we know every level of the laplacian pyramid is essentially a BPF with no intersection between the bands.
combining all the laplacians produces the original images because we tae all the frequencies of the original image.
giving every level different coefficient means lowering the amplitude of the frequencies in the specific band.
this way we can achieve different types of filters such as BF,LP,HP.
